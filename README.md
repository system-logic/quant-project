# Quant-Project: North Star

Engineering automation and decision logic for DC-DC converter optimization under computational constraints.

## 🎯 The Goal

Build a fully automated pipeline for power electronics simulation, data-driven optimization, and EMC noise analysis. From matrix thinking to production-ready systems.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.11
* **Environment:** Conda (Miniforge)
* **Core:** NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
* **Optimization:** Optuna, PyTorch
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, GitHub Actions

## 🗺 Roadmap (The 12-Week Sprint)

*Based on the "Decision Logic" Manifesto.*

### Phase 1: Foundations (Month 1)

* [x] **Week 1: Vectorized Signal Physics** — Memory efficiency, dtypes, and broadcasting logic.
* [ ] **Week 2: Advanced NumPy & Performance** — Eliminating loops, Einstein notation (`einsum`).
* [ ] **Week 3: Data Architecture** — Pandas for engineering metrics (Efficiency, Ripple).
* [ ] **Week 4: Automated Simulations** — Connecting Python to solver engines.

### Phase 2: Automation & ML (Month 2)

* [ ] **Week 5: Dataset Engineering** — Generation of 10k+ simulation runs.
* [ ] **Week 6: Statistical Analysis** — EMC noise characterization.
* [ ] **Week 7: Optimization Loops** — Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna.
* [ ] **Week 8: Deployment** — Containerizing the pipeline with Docker.

### Phase 3: Market & Scaling (Month 3)

* [ ] **Week 9-12:** Real-time constraints, Quant Finance integration, and Portfolio finalization.

## 🧪 Methodology

Every step follows the **System Logic Lab** protocol:

1. **Thesis:** Why this approach?
2. **Assumptions:** What do we take for granted?
3. **Constraints:** What are our limits?
4. **Failures:** Documented errors in `failures.md`.
